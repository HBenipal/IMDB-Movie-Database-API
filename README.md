# IMDB-Movie-Database-API
This program asks the user to search for a movie. Using the OMDB API, it gets all the movies under that name and put them in a file. 
I get the string response, parse to a JSON Object and then get each value. 
Then the user can sort through this file. Working on making it look better. I used to Java Swing Framework for the GUI.

I downloaded the json.simple package which allowed me to use the JSON Objects and parse the json response. 
  Here is the link to downloading the package: https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.github.cliftonlabs/json-simple/2.1.2/source-code. 
  After you download it, make sure that the jar file inside the zip and the zip are both in the same location as the .java file. Then go to the "Edit" button at the top, click "preferences", 
  click "Add" on the extra Classpath option at the bottom. Select the jar file that was inside the zip. Then click "apply" and then "ok" at the buttom.

Here is a link to the preview:
