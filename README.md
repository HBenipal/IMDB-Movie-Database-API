# IMDB-Movie-Database-API
This program asks the user to search for a movie. Using the OMDB API, it gets all the movies under that name and put them in a file. 
I get the string response, parse to a JSON Object and then get each value. 
Then the user can sort through this file. Working on making it look better.
